The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Counties with smaller populations or more challenging survey conditions tend to have larger margins of error, making them more vulnerable to being misclassified or underserved by algorithms. Such areas require additional manual review or supplemental data in policy applications.]\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- bind_rows(\n  county_data %>% filter(moe_pct_income < 5) %>% slice(1),     # High\n  county_data %>% filter(moe_pct_income >= 5 & moe_pct_income <= 10) %>% slice(1),  # Moderate\n  county_data %>% filter(moe_pct_income > 10) %>% slice(1)     # Low\n)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\nknitr::kable(\n  selected_counties %>%\n    select(NAME, median_incomeE, moe_pct_income, reliability),\n  digits = 2,\n  col.names = c(\"County\", \"Median Income\", \"MOE %\", \"Reliability\"),\n  caption = \"Selected Counties by MOE Percentage (Different Confidence Levels)\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Selected Counties by MOE Percentage (Different Confidence Levels)\n\n|County  | Median Income| MOE %|Reliability         |\n|:-------|-------------:|-----:|:-------------------|\n|Adams   |         78975|  4.22|High Confidence     |\n|Cameron |         46186|  5.64|Moderate Confidence |\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [write something :)]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.
