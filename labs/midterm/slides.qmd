## Are current property tax assessments in Philadelphia fair and accurate?

- Property taxes depend on OPA’s assessed values.  
- Assessments often deviate from actual sale prices.  
- Some areas are consistently over- or under-assessed.  
- Unequal assessments create unfair tax burdens.  
- **Key Question:** Are OPA assessments accurate and equitable across the city?

> Many zones fall outside this range — showing geographic bias in assessments.

## Motivations

Fairness: Ensure residents pay taxes aligned with true property values.

Transparency: Build trust through objective, data-based methods.

Efficiency: Improve city revenue stability and policy planning.

Traditional assessments rely on outdated, manual approaches.

Machine learning models can better capture local market dynamics.

## Larger homes, higher neighborhood income, and more bathrooms increase prices — while older properties tend to sell for less.

## Adding more real-world data to build a more fair and accurate housing price model

**Model Evolution**
- M1: Basic home features (size, age) → simple but limited  
- M2: + Census data → adds community context  
- M3: + Spatial data → captures location effects  
- M4: + Interactions → reflects real neighborhood differences

## Core factors like home size and bathrooms remain important across all models, while neighborhood and location features gain influence as data become more detailed.

**Observations**
- Structural features (bathrooms, livable area) stay top-ranked across all models  
- Socioeconomic and spatial factors (income, census tract) rise in importance as they’re added  
- Final model shows *location effects* becoming dominant predictors of price

## Model Performance: The predicted prices from our final model align strongly with actual sales.
Our approach can reliably estimate market values across neighborhoods.

## The map highlights neighborhoods where predicted prices differ most from actual sales.

These areas, shown in deep red or blue, are likely where property assessments are least accurate, and where tax fairness may be at greatest risk.

**Interpretation**
- **Blue areas:** Homes undervalued by the model → may face *under-assessment*  
- **Red areas:** Homes overvalued → may face *over-assessment*  
- **Central & southern zones** show the largest mismatches — indicating uneven market patterns

> These “hard-to-predict” areas should be prioritized for review in future assessment updates.

---

## Three Evidence-Based Recommendations

Review Where the Model Shows the Largest Gaps
→ Our residual analysis pinpoints neighborhoods with the highest prediction errors — the same areas where assessments are likely least fair.
Prioritize these zones for reassessment and data verification.

Use the Model as a Fairness Benchmark
→ Instead of replacing official assessments, use the model as a cross-check tool to flag properties with unusually high or low assessed-to-predicted ratios.

Institutionalize Annual Model Updates
→ Retrain the model each year using new sales and census data so assessments stay current with real market trends, preventing future inequities.

## Limitations & Next Steps

**Data Coverage and Quality**

Property sales data may not fully represent the entire housing stock — especially under-assessed or low-transaction neighborhoods.

Inconsistent or missing entries (e.g., renovation status, multi-unit conversions) can affect accuracy.

**Unobserved Neighborhood Factors**

The model cannot fully capture intangible influences such as school reputation, street conditions, or historical value perceptions that affect prices.

**Static Model Timing**

Our predictions are based on 2023–2024 data; housing markets change quickly.

Without periodic updates, accuracy and fairness will decline over time.
