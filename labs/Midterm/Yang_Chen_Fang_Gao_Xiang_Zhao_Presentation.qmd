## Are current property tax assessments in Philadelphia fair and accurate?

::::: columns
::: column
- Property taxes depend on OPA’s assessed values.\

- Assessments often deviate from actual sale prices.\

- Some areas are consistently over- or under-assessed.\

- Unequal assessments create unfair tax burdens.

Accuracy, Uniformity & Equity of Philadelphia’s 2023 Real Estate
Assessments</em> (Apr 2024). ]{style="font-size:0.9em; color:#475569;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivations

**Fairness**: Ensure residents pay taxes aligned with true property values.

**Transparency**: Build trust through objective, data-based methods.

**Efficiency**: Improve city revenue stability and policy planning.


>Traditional assessments rely on outdated, manual approaches.

>Machine learning models can better capture local market dynamics.

## Data Sources

- Philadelphia Property Sales (n= 24023,2023-2024)

- Census ACS (Income, Education, Poverty)

- OpenDataPhilly (Number and Distance: Crime, Park&Recreation,
Transportation, Hospital,School )

## Larger homes, higher neighborhood income, and more bathrooms increase prices — while older properties tend to sell for less. {.tiny}

## Adding more real-world data to build a more fair and accurate housing price model {.tiny}
<span style="font-size:0.7em;">M1: Basic home features (size, age) → simple but
limited

<span style="font-size:0.7em;">M2: + Census data → adds community context

<span style="font-size:0.7em;">M3: + Spatial data → captures location effects

<span style="font-size:0.7em;">M4: + Interactions → reflects real neighborhood differences

![](images/ols_4model_performance.png){width="130%" fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Home size and bathrooms remain important across all models, while neighborhood and location features gain influence after improving. {.tiny}

::::: columns
::: column
- **Bathrooms** and **Livable area** stay top-ranked across all models\
- **Income** and **Census tract** rise in importance as they’re added\
- Final model shows **Location Effects** becoming dominant predictors of price

## Model Performance: The predicted prices from our final model align strongly with actual sales. {.tiny}

## The map highlights neighborhoods where predicted prices differ most from actual sales. {.tiny}
::::: columns
::: column


<span style="font-size:0.6em;">**Interpretation**

<span style="font-size:0.4em;">**Blue areas:** Homes undervalued by the model → may face *under-assessment*

<span style="font-size:0.4em;">**Red areas:** Homes overvalued → may face *over-assessment*

<span style="font-size:0.4em;">**Central & southern zones:** show the largest mismatches — indicating
uneven market patterns

<span style="font-size:0.6em;"> > The areas, shown in deep red or blue, are likely where property assessments are least accurate, and where tax fairness may be at greatest risk.

<span style="font-size:0.6em;"> > These “hard-to-predict” areas should be prioritized for review in future assessment updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Three Evidence-Based Recommendations

**Review Where the Model Shows the Largest Gaps** → Our residual analysis
pinpoints neighborhoods with the highest prediction errors — the same
areas where assessments are likely least fair. Prioritize these zones
for reassessment and data verification.

**Use the Model as a Fairness Benchmark** → Instead of replacing official
assessments, use the model as a cross-check tool to flag properties with
unusually high or low assessed-to-predicted ratios.

**Institutionalize Annual Model Updates** → Retrain the model each year
using new sales and census data so assessments stay current with real
market trends, preventing future inequities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations & Improvements


**Data gaps**: Some neighborhoods have limited or inconsistent sales data, and important local factors like school quality or public amenities are not fully represented.

**Spatial variation**: The model’s accuracy differs across regions — it performs very well in some areas but less so in others, suggesting that geography strongly influences results.

**Spatial modeling**: Next, we will apply models that explicitly account for spatial relationships and neighborhood effects to improve prediction accuracy.

**Data enhancement**: We plan to expand data coverage in underrepresented areas to reduce bias and strengthen fairness across communities.
