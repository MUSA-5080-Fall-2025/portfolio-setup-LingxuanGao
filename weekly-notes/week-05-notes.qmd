**Relationships & Predictions**

## P1 The Statistical Learning Framework

**Statistical learning = a set of approaches for estimating that relationship**

### Parametric Approach: Linear Regression
The assumption: Relationship between X and Y is linear

Y≈β0+β1X1+β2X2+...+βpXp

The task: Estimate the β coefficients using our sample data

The method: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

## P2 Two Different Goals
