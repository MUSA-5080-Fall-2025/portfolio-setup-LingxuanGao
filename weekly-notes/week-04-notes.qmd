# Spatial Data & GIS Operations in R

## P1 Data Fundamentals

### Vector Data Model

Three basic types:

Points → Locations (schools, hospitals, crime incidents)
Lines → Linear features (roads, rivers, transit routes)
Polygons → Areas (census tracts, neighborhoods, service areas)

Each feature has:

Geometry → Shape and location
Attributes → Data about that feature (population, income, etc.)

### sf Package
**Spatial data is just data.frame + geometry column**

**Common spatial data formats**:

Shapefiles (.shp + supporting files)
GeoJSON (.geojson)
KML/KMZ (Google Earth)
Database connections (PostGIS)

## P2 Spatial Operations
**Spatial Subsetting**:Extract features based on spatial relationships

## P3 Geometry Operations

### Buffer Operations
Create zones around features

## P4 Coordinate Reference Systems

### Geographic vs. Projected Coordinates

**Geographic Coordinate Systems (GCS)**:

Latitude/longitude coordinates
Units: decimal degrees
Good for: Global datasets, web mapping
Bad for: Area/distance calculations

**Coordinate Systems (PCS)**:

X/Y coordinates on a flat plane
Units: meters, feet, etc.
Good for: Local analysis, accurate measurements
Bad for: Large areas, global datasets

### Common Coordinate Reference Systems

**WGS84 (EPSG:4326)**

GPS standard, global coverage
Geographic system (lat/lon)
Good for web mapping, data sharing

**Web Mercator (EPSG:3857)**

Web mapping standard
Projected system
Heavily distorts areas near pole

**State Plane / UTM zones**

Local accuracy
Different zones for different regions
Optimized for specific geographic areas

**Albers Equal Area**

Preserves area
Good for demographic/statistical analysis
Widely used in national-scale thematic maps

## Summary

### Policy Analysis Workflow

1.Load data → Get spatial boundaries and attribute data
2.Check projections → Transform to appropriate CRS
3.Join datasets → Combine spatial and non-spatial data
4.Spatial operations → Buffers, intersections, distance calculations
5.Aggregation → Summarize across spatial units
6.Visualization → Maps and charts
7.Interpretation → Policy recommendations
