# Spatial Data & GIS Operations in R

## Spatial Data Fundamentals

### Vector Data Model

Three basic types:

Points → Locations (schools, hospitals, crime incidents)
Lines → Linear features (roads, rivers, transit routes)
Polygons → Areas (census tracts, neighborhoods, service areas)

Each feature has:

Geometry → Shape and location
Attributes → Data about that feature (population, income, etc.)

### sf Package
**Spatial data is just data.frame + geometry column**
